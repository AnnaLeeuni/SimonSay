The design includes the following classes:

SimonWorld: This class represents the world of the game and has fields for the current Simon sequence, 
the current player sequence, and various boolean variables to keep track of the state of the game. 
It also has fields for the images of the four buttons, and methods to handle mouse clicks and clock ticks.

Button: This class represents one of the four buttons in the game. 
It has a color field and methods to draw the button when it is dark or lit, 
and to compare two buttons to see if they are the same.

ILoButton: This interface represents a list of buttons. 
It has methods to reverse the sequence, get the button at a certain index, 
get the length of the sequence, and check if it begins with another list of buttons.

MtLoButton: This class represents an empty list of buttons. 
It has methods to reverse the sequence, get the length of the sequence, 
and check if it begins with another list of buttons.

ConsLoButton: This class represents a non-empty list of buttons. 
It has a first field representing the first button in the sequence, 
and a rest field representing the rest of the sequence. 
It has methods to reverse the sequence, get the button at a certain index, 
get the length of the sequence, and check if it begins with another list of buttons.
